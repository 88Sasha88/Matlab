# Matlab
PhysicsEducationResearchDataProcessing.m was data processing for a physics educations research case study on mindset in introductory physics courses. ElectricPotentialOfPointCharge2D.m, SashasLaplacian.m, and findLaplacian.m were files I made for pedagogical use with students in upper-division Electromagnetism. My professor needed someone who had already taken the class to write them.
